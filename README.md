# NOTES
# Main Objective: finishing this project before 
##  1/11/2023
  ### Start of the project.
    Multiplexing handled using select. Uncharted territory in our school, 
    we are the only group that uses SELECT() for ft_IRC project.
    Transmiting of messages works.
    We are using Hexchat for reference.
    We need to chose which commands we need to implement for our project. For now we have beta PASS PRIVMSG INFO.
    5/5 day as a team.
