# NOTES
# Main Objective: finishing this project before 
##  1/11/2023
  ### Start of the project.
    Multiplexing handled using select. Uncharted territory in our school, 
    we are the only group that uses SELECT() for ft_IRC project.
    Transmiting of messages works.
    We are using Hexchat for reference.
    We need to chose which commands we need to implement for our project. For now we have beta PASS PRIVMSG INFO.
    5/5 day as a team. 
-----------------------------------------
##  2/11/2023
  ### Second day.
    Password check is near perfect. We are stress testing it.
    Colors added.
    Establishing modularity using a map for all commands.
    Our brain melted ...
    2/5 day because rain. frustrated kinda day.
-----------------------------------------
##  3/11/2023
  ### Third day.
    Ascii art added (Emre).
    Modularity added (Emircan).
    Kick started chanels (Ëš5) (Talha).
    /PASS changed to PASS in nc.
    We need to understand how to use signal ^D to send a message immediatly from nc.
    Well played boys.
-----------------------------------------
## 4/11/2023
  ### Fourth day.
    Made slight changes to the github repo.
    Nick and User added (Need to do slight changes to User to get the information in the right way).
    Channel class was updated, 1 user cannot join the same channel 2 times.
    Major step in hexchat we were able to create a channel. Number 5 indeed.
    ^D signal works.
    great day.
    Congrats indeed. Wp team.
-----------------------------------------
## 5/11/2023
  ### Fifth day.
    Vacational and busy day for all of us. We worked really good so far.
-----------------------------------------
## 6/11/2023
  ### sixth day.
    What a good day, the purpose of this day was to create a channel that we could chat on.
    We were able to do more than that.
    We recreated the function TOPIC and INVITE today.
    We eased on Authentication it works really good.
    Divided the socket and the server files because Server::Run() was getting overwhelming.
    We added a CAP file to understand which client was being used HEX or nc.
    Funny enough whilst connecting hexchat sended CAP LS, PASS, NICK and USER piece by piece always in this order.
    Every now and then it sends CAP LS than PASS ... algather. or CAP LS and PASS than the rest ex. 
    For that reason we recreated a buffer system which gets them line by line.
    In general this was probably the day that we worked the best.
-----------------------------------------
## 7/11/2023
  ### seventh day.
    Debug isini duzeltelim. Her page'e ozel Debug olsun ve tanimlamalari Utilities de tutalim orn NICK.cpp #ifdef DEBUG_NICK, DEBUG_NICK_I, DEBUG_NICK_II..
    User'da aldigimiz formati degistirelim gorkemlerinki gibi 4 sifat girilsin. (3. input hatirladigim kadariyla.)
    hexchat ve nc ayrimi yapip ona gore bir mesaj gonderelim.
    to do listteki protocolslere bir goz atalim.
    Diger Komutlara bakalim. (Pong, Ping kolay denilenleri hizlica ekleyelim.)
    Her gonderilen mesaj ve read write farkli renklerde server terminaline basilsin debugging isini cok kolaylastirir.
    Parslandiginda cmd1 null olmamali.
    Kendi exeptionumuzu yazmak daha cool olur boylelikle ozellestirebiliriz.
    NOTICE, WHO, PING & PONG
    Operator islerinde baslayabiliriz.
    TOPIC herkesinkini degistirsin. Ve operatore ozel olsun.
    Sagda ad cikarma ve mesajda ad gorme ve tiklayip priv gonderme.
